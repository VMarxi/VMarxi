- ðŸ‘‹ Hi all, Iâ€™m @MarxiVii, you may call me by both Victor and Marxi~
- I'm a bachelor in design, with background on both digital and traditional art, but as of now I'm shifting careers towards coding and possibly mobile development too.
- Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Java and JavaScript, and I intend on learning Kotlin soon
- Feel free to invite me for collaboration on almost anything, really. It'll help with my learning~
- ðŸ“« You can reach me through messages here, I'll take a look at them daily.
