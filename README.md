- 👋 Hi y'all, I’m Victor, you may call me by Vii or Marxi~
- 🎨 I'm a bachelor in design, with background on both digital and traditional art, but as of now I'm shifting careers towards coding. I'm mostly interested in back-end since it seems more fun, but I guess my current skills will translate well into front-end.
- 📝 I’m currently learning Python at the CESAR Next program and I'll soon learn Java through it as well. I also started studying HTML, CSS and JavaScript through freecodecamp.org.
- 💻 Feel free to invite me for collaboration on almost anything, really. It'll help with my learning~
- 📣 Reach me through my LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/victormcavalcanti/  
- 📫 Or through my e-mail victor.mcavalcanti@gmail.com
